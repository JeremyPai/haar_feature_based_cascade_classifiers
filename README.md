# Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers

This project aims to use cascade classifier which is implemented and trained by OpenCV.
Just trying to know how it works, its performance, and limit.

For more description about this project, I wrote a medium artical about it. Check this out! [link](https://medium.com/lifes-a-struggle/haar-feature-based-cascade-classifiers-5ef4c33af02b)

Also, if you're interested in this method, you can find OpenCV for more model trained in different tasks. [model](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
